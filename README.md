# Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclist Case Study

This project is my completion of the Google Data Analytics Capstone, analyzing Cyclist ride data using **R** and **Quarto**.

## 📈 Overview

- Used real-world cyclist data to answer business questions and provide insights.
- Analysis performed with R and documented with Quarto.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **R**
- **Quarto**
- Data visualization packages (e.g., tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr)

## 📊 Key Insights
Summary of results
With respect to casual rider the following could be noted:
- Casual riders have, on average, more trip duration than members
- The highest casual rides are on weekends, specifically Saturdays

Recommedation
It is recommended that the marketing team should focus on marketing to casual riders on weekends, this ensure that the most casual riders are converted.
This could be done by sending "promotion" notification to such members on Saturday morning. 
This could be combined with showing them how much they could save by converting to members.
